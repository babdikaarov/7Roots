# Portfolio project

## For this project, you will build an application using everything you’ve learned. Unlike the previous projects, what you build is up to you. We will provide some ideas to get started but we want this project to be something that you are passionate about building

Think about:

- An application that you wish exists but doesn’t
- What you can build to solve a problem that you, your family, or your friends have

Here are some starting ideas to inspire you:

- A movie finder application the [Movie Database API](https://www.themoviedb.org/)
- A productivity app like [Todoist](https://todoist.com/)
- A Pokedex using the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/)
- A Gif browser using the [Giphy API](https://developers.giphy.com/)

These ideas require you to learn a few additional technologies on your own:

- A single/multiplayer game using [Canvas](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Canvas_API) or [Phaser](https://phaser.io/)
- A mobile application using [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- A data visualization using [D3.js](https://d3js.org/)
- A virtual reality application using [React 360](https://facebook.github.io/react-360/)
- An interactive 3D visualization using [Three.js](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber)

Project Requirements:

- Build the application using React and Redux
- Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub
- Use a project management tool (GitHub Projects, Trello, etc.) to plan your work
- Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project including:
  - Wireframes
  - Technologies used
  - Features
  - Future work

- Write unit tests for your components
- Write end-to-end tests for your application
- Users can use the application on any device (desktop to mobile)
- Users can use the application on any modern browser
- Users can access your application at a URL
  - This means your application should be hosted online
- Users are delighted with a cohesive design system
- Users are delighted with animations and transitions
- Users are able to leave an error states
  - Think about bad API calls, network failures. When an event like that happens, your app shouldn’t crash but provide a user a means to get back to a working state (retry button, go back button, etc.)
- Get 90+ scores on [Lighthouse](https://web.dev/measure/)
- OPTIONAL: Get a custom domain name and use it for your application
- OPTIONAL: Set up a CI/CD workflow to automatically deploy your application when the master branch in the repository changes
- OPTIONAL: Make your application a progressive web app

Prerequisites:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- Redux
- Git and GitHub
- Enzyme and Jest
- Selenium
- Command line and file navigation
- Wireframing
- SEO fundamentals

## Feeling stuck? Try the following

- Google your question: oftentimes, someone has had the same question as you! Check out websites like StackOverflow and Quora to see how other folks have found solutions.
- Read the documentation: make sure to carefully read through the documentation for any languages and libraries that you are using. Oftentimes they’ll have examples of what you’re looking for!
- Rubber ducking: try to explain a problem to a friend or co-worker. Oftentimes you’ll figure out the solution as you’re trying to explain it. And if not, getting another pair of eyes on your code can be helpful.
